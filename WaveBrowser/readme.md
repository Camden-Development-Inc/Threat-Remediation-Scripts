# Remediation Script for WaveBrowser aka WebNavigator

## Steps to remediate

- Temporarily Stops Browser sessions during remediation. (Optional)
- Removes WaveBrowser from the Filesystem.
- Removes WaveBrowser Services
- Removes WaveBrowser Scheduled tasks.
- Removes WaveBrowser Registry Keys
- Removes WaveBrowser Uninstall Key

### Tested on Windows 10/11

### Why multiple scripts?

- The scripts are decided by operating systems and have a BrowserKill feature if needed.  It is not always required as CrowdStrike blocks the activity.

*Update 04-05-2022: *

- There are scripts for both Windows 10 and Windows 7.  If the check shows that WaveBrowser is still in-use and cannot be removed, the browser will need to be killed in which you can utilized the BrowserKill script.  This was done to avoid end-user impact.

*Update 06-02-2022 *

- A big thank you to GitHub user @jendahl12 for the report.  A removal and check was added for the WaveBrowser uninstall registry key.  This was done so that System Center Configuration Manager can verify and confirm the remediation.

*Update 08-02-2022 *

- Optimizations were made to all WaveBrowser scripts.  I Nested the checks and remediation instead of separating them.  Organized the code a bit better ðŸ‘Œ.

*Update 11-29-2022 *

- Additional registry key paths have been added to the remediation script.
