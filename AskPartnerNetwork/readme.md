### Description

I created an automated script to remove AskPartnerNetwork.  This script does not require CrowdStrike to run, however, I did create this script for CrowdStrike.  The script was 
made because Crowdstrike does not know how to interpret environmental variables properly.  If you experience any issues running the script, feel free to drop in an issue.
