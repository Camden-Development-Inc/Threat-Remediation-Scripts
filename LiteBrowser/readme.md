# LightBrowser Remediation script

### Actions
- Terminates processes associated with LightBrowser
- Remove LightBrowser from the file system.
- Remove LightBrowser registry keys.
- Performs checks to ensure removal was completed and lets you know if it wasn't successful.

### Description

I created an automated script to remove LightBrowser.  This script does not require CrowdStrike to run, however, I did create this script for CrowdStrike.  The script was 
made because Crowdstrike does not know how to interpret environmental variables properly.  If you experience any issues running the script, feel free to drop in an issue.
